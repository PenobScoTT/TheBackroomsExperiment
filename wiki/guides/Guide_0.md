# Guide 0: Getting Started

## Chapter 0: First join
When you join for the first time, you will end up in <a href="../levels/Level_0.md">Level 0</a>.
The first thing you should do is to find a door with an exit sign on top it.
Go thorugh it and you will find yourself in <a href="../levels/Level_1.md">Level 1</a>.

## Chapter 1: Level 1
When you are in Level 1, it is important to get as many items as possible.
This includes food, knifes and almond water.<br/>
You firstly should go away from your spawn point, until you find the first chests that contian loot.
Take a crowbar/knife out of the chest. From now on you can break loor crates with the tool.
Break as many as you can. You will need the items later.<br/>
I recommend to get at least:
* 1 Stack of food items
* 2-3 tools to break crates
* A lot of almond water
