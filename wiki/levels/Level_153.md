# Level 153: Vintage Office Building

## Description
This level is an office building, filled with vintage desks, computers, elevators, clocks, bookshelves etc. In there, you may occasionally find the headquarters of some colonies but there are no members around. There is a very small chance to come across a room with the Prime Book that is suspected of containing every secret of the backrooms, but cannot be deciphered.
